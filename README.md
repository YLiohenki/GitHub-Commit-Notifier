# GitHubCoach
Github Coach is an android app to help you keep your commits streak.

It's notifies you after 2 pm, that you have to commit today.

Also it shows number of your commits for this week.

## Installation

Currently you have to build it yourself with Xamarin. Going to resolve it in couple of days.
